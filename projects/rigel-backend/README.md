# Rigel Backend (Placeholder)

Future home for the control/companion service that the Rigel plugin will talk
with.  The backend will eventually coordinate preset sync, account data, and
asset delivery for advanced plugin workflows.

## Envisioned Responsibilities
- Authenticate users coming from the plugin and future web UI.
- Store/serve wavetable packs, presets, and automation data generated by
  `wtgen` and the broader community.
- Offer a realtime API (WebSockets or WebRTC) so the plugin can mirror changes
  made in the site dashboard.

## Design TODOs
1. Choose the primary runtime (Rust Axum/Tonic, Go, or TypeScript/Node).
2. Define the API surface that the plugin requires (handshake, session keep
   alive, patch fetch, telemetry uploads, etc.).
3. Draft data models and persistence approach (SQLite for local dev, Postgres
   in production, S3 for large payloads).
4. Establish integration testing strategy so plugin/CLI/site can reuse shared
   contract tests.
